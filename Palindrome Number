Question 2:

Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
palindrome
, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

-231 <= x <= 231 - 1
 

Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

Answer 2:

class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        int n=x;
        int rem=0;
        int rev=0;

        if (x<0){
            return false;
        }
        while(n>0){
            rem = n%10;
            rev = rev*10+rem;
            n=n/10;
        }
        if (rev==x){
            return true;
        }
        return false;        
    }
}
